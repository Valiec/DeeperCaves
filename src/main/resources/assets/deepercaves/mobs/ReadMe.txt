What's changed
==============================
+ I've taken the liberty of creating shadow skins just for the "Deep" mobs.  As described in the original Deeper Caves post, it says that the mobs were darker versions of themselves with red, glowing eyes.  I figured the glowing eyes could easily be remade similar to how spider's eyes normally glow, btu I didn't bother making the .PNG files for them, since I didn't know if you knew how to code them in or not.


===============MTX's Stuff===============

<<<<<The Specter>>>>>
Taking advantage of 1.9's new semi-transparent skin, I've managed to make a ghostly Steve... minus a few features.  These mobs only appear in the Final Labyrinth, and cannot be killed by normal means, either it be by explosions, arrows, weapons, but by light itself.  Upon being exposed to light levels greater than 0, it'll simply vanish.  No death animation, no particles, no drops... just nothing.  While you can't hurt it, it CAN hurt you, dealing different damage depending on what tool it's weilding (It'll mostly be holding nothing, but sometimes may spawn with a silver pickaxe, sword or shovel.)


<<<<<The Shadow Mobs>>>>>
I felt that having them just have more HP isn't all that threatening.  I've decided to come up with a few solutions that can make the mobs more frightful to encounter.

Shadow Zombies are capable of breaking down wooden doors within seconds, and iron doors taking as long as a normal wooden door to regular zombies.  Their movement has also been increased, being able to catch up to a running player easily.  They deal 5 full hearts of damage upon contact, and will inflict the hunger debuff for 10 seconds.

Shadow Skeletons are now even MORE annoying since they can shoot arrows more frequently and strafe much quicker.  They often spawn more with enchanted bows, so expect them to deal more damage, knock you back farther, and sometimes set you ablaze.

Shadow Spiders are capable of jumping roughly four blocks high, being immune to ALL fall damage.  While they only deal the normal amount of damage a regular spider would deal, they inflict the blindness debuff for 3 seconds, which is what makes the Shadow Spiders truly threatening.

Shadow Creepers are capable of exploding in a radius similar to that of a supercharged Creeper.  They don't maintain the ability to blow other mob's heads off, though.  They're also capable of teleporting, similar to Endermen.

As mentioned above, all shadow based-mobs have double the amount their normal health, but I feel that they're STILL not threatening enough... so I've decided to let these mobs spawn with random positive potion effects, such as speed, strength, resistance, and restoration.  I also want the Shadow mobs to be capable of spawning at ANY light level, regardless if the light level is even somehow at 15.

However, I've felt that while these mobs are tough, they should at least reward the player for their troubles.  All the above listed enemies will drop DOUBLE the normal drops, and paired with enchanted looting weaponry will make a VERY fun time for players with higher-tier gear!
