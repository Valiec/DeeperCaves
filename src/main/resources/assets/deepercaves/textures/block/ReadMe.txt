===============MTX's Stuff===============

<<<<<Crystalline Formations & Blocks>>>>>
These are usually found within the "Crystal" level, forming in huge veins similar to coal.

Upon breaking these beatuiful stones with a pickaxe, the player will recieve 1-4 crystal shards of that color type, which can be crafted into a block in using 4 of the crystal shards.  If the player has a silkl touch pickaxe, than the player can simply mine it can get the whole block.

These crystals act as an alternative to stained glass, being slightly harder to see through, but have the blast resistance and strength of normal stone.


<<<<<Blooddied Stone>>>>>
Generates in the "Near Nether" level.  It starts to generate in heavier amounts once the player gets closer to the Nether's "ceiling."  This block is purely for visual building and serves no other purpose.


<<<<<Magma Stone>>>>>
Generates in the "Lava" level.  This block will spawn in HUGE veins very frequently in this layer.

There are two variants of this stone, being the "True Magma Stone" which spawns a lava block at it's location upon mining it, and the "False Magma Stone" variant which won't spawn a block of lava upon mining it.  Both variants of this block type can be mined up using a silk touch pickaxe.  When using a normal pickaxe, however, either of the blocks won't drop anything.

When any entity stands on top of a Magma Stone, they'll immediately catch fire and start to burn.

<<<<<Rotting Planks>>>>>
These blocks generate within abandoned villages found in the Abandoned Caves layer.

Wooden planks that have been ravaged by the elements as time passed by.  Attempting to collect these without a silk touch axe will result in them dropping nothing but particles of aged, withered wood.  They also have a 10% chance of spawning Termites, which are essentially the wood variations of Silverfish.

<<<<<Rusty Bars>>>>>
These blocks generate within the abandoned villages found in the Abandoned Caves layer.

Iron bars that have been deteriorated by years upon years of neglect and environmental damage.  Attempting to collect these blocks without using a silk touch pickaxe will destroy the bars and drop nothing in return.

<<<<<Ruby Ore>>>>>
This type of ore can be found within the Crystal layer, spawning at the same rate as Sapphire Ore.
