What's changed
==============================
+ Replaced the old Aquamarine texture (recolored Lapis) with a new, custom sprite.

+ Touched up the Sapphire texture so it looks a tad shinier!

+ Made ALL silver items shinier in comparison to other ingots (so it's easier to tell the difference between Iron and silver ingots.)

+ Modified the Evanescite gemstone to look more shiner.

+ Tenebrium Ingot now drips with the inky darkness of melted tendrils.

+ Replaced the Vesperite Gem's recolored Evanescite Gem texture with it's own, unique sprite.

+ Touched up the Forgotten Gemstone texture so it's MUCH shinier now.

+ Compltely remade the Void Charm's texture (Added Evanescite Gemstones to the Void Charm now, requiring all materials present only in the dark and abandoned cavern levels.

+ Added Tenebrium Pickaxe texture (see MTX's suggestions!)

+ Gave the Void Charm a completely new sprite

+ Gave the Ametrine Armor & Tools an overhaul (see MTX's suggestions.)


===============MTX's Stuff===============

<<<<<Dripping Tenebrium Ingot>>>>>
Tenebrium Ore that has been smelted in a furnace once has reduced the inky tendrils of the shadows into a withering, dripping blob.  The player needs to smelt these "raw" ingots in order to obtain an ingot that can be used to craft various Tenebrium items.

<<<<<Tenebrium Pickaxe>>>>>
The Tenebrium Pickaxe's mining speed and durability are equal to wood, but however, does have a mining power that's GREATER than diamond, which can be used to mine Forgotten Ore & Fragmented Bedrock.

<<<<<Silver Tools & Armor>>>>>
Silver armor and tools will provide the player with the same durability and power as iron, but the enchantment power of gold.

<<<<<Ametrine Tools & Armor>>>>>
Ametrine tools and armor have DOUBLE the durability and same power of diamond, but all tools have 3-block radius abilities, so the scythe will till 3x3 blocks of land, the pickaxe will mine 3x3x3 blocks, the sword will attack enemies within a 3x3x3 radius, etc.
